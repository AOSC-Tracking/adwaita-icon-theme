The age of hackers supplying their own artwork is over. For the sake of our
users, please leave the pixelpushin' to the artists. Please file a request

Bugs and Requests
-----------------

Requests for icons that will be useful for more than a asingle application and

(bugzilla.gnome.org) under the gnome-icon-theme module.
